IOTA v1.3.009 - plotter updates

IOTA Plotter

    1. Added a generic table figure, which takes table data in a list-of-lists
       format and creates a table as a MatPlotLib figure
       - This is to display text with special characters on all platforms
       - Only unicode works for sure; LaTeX has not been tested or debugged

    2. Streamlined Plotter panel to be more generic
    3. Added more customization to plot draw and layout methods
    4. Added more sizing and position customization to the base IOTA frame

PRIME Plotter

    1. Subclassed from IOTA plotter, and streamlined
    2. Separate outputs of Table 1 as text and Table 1 as MatPlotLib figure

Known issues

    1. PRIME doesn't launch in a wxPython4 environment
    2. PRIME doesn't exit cleanly on Mac OS X (okay in Linux)
